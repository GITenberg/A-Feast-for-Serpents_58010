3</span>PREFACE.</h2>
<p><span class="smcap"><i>To</i></span><i> the Church of Jesus
Christ</i>, <i>who are loved with an everlasting love</i>,
<i>chosen in Christ before all worlds</i>&mdash;<i>redeemed by
the blood of the Lamb</i>&mdash;<i>and effectually called out of
darkness into marvellous light</i>; <i>led by the providence of
God to attend the ministry of so unworthy an instrument as
myself</i>, <i>to whom God has made my labors useful</i>, <i>and
profitable for reformation</i>, <i>conviction</i>,
<i>conversion</i>, <i>building up</i>, <i>and spiritual
consolation</i>.&nbsp; <i>Having been much tried and perplexed by
men of corrupt minds</i>, <i>who have long endeavoured to
prejudice me</i>, <i>with a view to separate us one from the
other</i>, <i>but they have hitherto failed</i>&mdash;<i>having
grace given you to continue with me in my temptations</i>, <i>to
abide in the furnace of affliction with me</i>, <i>and to stand
in the evil day</i>.&nbsp; <i>The good hand of God</i>,
<i>restoring a degree of peace to us</i>, <i>so that we can pass
to our Meeting Place of Worship unmolested</i>,&mdash;<i>I think
it right</i>, <i>and that I am in duty bound</i> (<i>though you
have not demanded it</i>) <i>to make a few general remarks upon
the subjects which have agitated the public</i>, <i>and not a
little distressed your minds</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span><i>I wish
you most decidedly to bear in mind thro&rsquo; the whole of this
performance</i>, <i>that I write only for your
sakes</i>&mdash;<i>I write not for the worldling</i>, <i>whose
heart is set on the things of time and sense</i>, <i>who</i>,
Gallio <i>like</i>, <i>cares for none of these things</i>,
<i>except it be to pass an unpleasant sneer at us</i>.&mdash;<i>I
write not for the proud Pharisee</i>, <i>or the mere
Formalist</i>, <i>who have a name to live and are
dead</i>&mdash;<i>I write not for Hypocrites</i>, <i>whose end
will be according to their work</i>, <i>and who are a perpetual
plague to the Household of Faith</i>&mdash;<i>Wolves in
Sheep&rsquo;s cloathing</i>, <i>who cover the vilest principles
and conduct with the garb of apparent holiness</i>!&mdash;<i>but
I write for those who know the plague of the heart</i>; <i>the
vanity of the world</i>; <i>the emptiness of the creature</i>;
<i>the danger of a form of godliness without the power</i>;
<i>the spirituality of God&rsquo;s most holy Law</i>; <i>the
preciousness of a dear Redeemer</i>; <i>the power of the
word</i>; <i>the manifestation of the atonement</i>.&nbsp;
<i>These characters so graciously taught</i>, <i>must be under
the influence of divine love</i>&mdash;<i>the remnant that shall
not do iniquity</i>, <i>nor speak lies</i>&mdash;<i>neither is a
deceitful tongue found in their mouths</i>; <i>but they feed on
the bread of eternal life</i>, <i>and can not be satisfied
without it</i>.&nbsp; <i>To these Characters I dedicate this
book</i>; <i>and not doubting but it will procure me many
foes</i>, <i>and stir up that carnal enmity which they are the
slaves of</i>, <i>for them I would put up that charitable prayer
of our Lord</i>, &ldquo;<i>Father forgive
them</i>;&rdquo;&mdash;<i>and of you I would use the fine
language of the blessed Apostle</i>&mdash;<i>And now</i>,

<h2><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>A
SERMON.</h2>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center"><span
class="GutSmall">&ldquo;AND DUST SHALL BE THE SERPENT&rsquo;S
MEAT.&rdquo;</span>&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i> lv, 25.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is a most undoubted truth, that,
as in the planetary system one star differs from another in
glory, so it is in the Church of God&mdash;though the elect are
loved alike, chosen and provided for alike, and shall all be
partakers of the same glory in ultimate bliss&mdash;the infant
who died this day, and the mind of the apostle Paul will be alike
there; yet, in the Church Militant it is not so.&nbsp; God the
divine Spirit, is a sovereign in all his dispensations; and while
some of the people of God have scarcely been known here, but
through the solitary lane of life, have pursued the noiseless
tenor of their way&mdash;treasures hid in the sand&mdash;a
Sparrow alone&mdash;a Pelican of the Wilderness&mdash;and, as
finely described by one of our Poets&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Full many a gem, of purest ray serine,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark unfathom&rsquo;d caves of ocean bear:<br />
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And lose its sweetness in the desert air.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>But
though this is the case with many, yet some have been more highly
favored, and shone with peculiar lustre in the Church of
God.&nbsp; All the Prophets testified of the adorable Redeemer,
but Isaiah shines like a star of the first magnitude.&nbsp; His
name signifies the Salvation of God; and he was a type of the
great Prophet of the Church of God.&nbsp; It is said, but without
any probable ground, he was the cousin of King Uzziah, in the
latter end of whose reign he began his predictions.&nbsp; His
qualifications were great, and his writings truly sublime, yet
his success was but small.&nbsp; A minister of small talents may
be more successful in his public work than a man of greater, but
this is according to the sovereign good-will and pleasure of
God.&mdash;After this great Prophet had borne his testimony for
God and truth about forty-five years, he died a martyr, perhaps
sawn asunder with a wooden saw, under the reign of
Manassah.&nbsp; He clearly foretels the incarnation of our Lord;
and probably he was the first to whom it was revealed that the
Messiah should be born of a virgin.&nbsp; His mind was led to
trace him through a life of sorrows, while he foretels his most
intimate acquaintance would be <i>grief</i>&mdash;acquainted with
grief, but his reward would be glorious.&nbsp; His name should be
great in all the world, and everlasting honours paid him, as
God-man Mediator.&mdash;This was the joy set before him, for
which he endured the Cross, and thought light of the
shame&mdash;the Father hath therefore highly exalted him, and <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>given him a
name above every other, that at his name every knee should bow,
if not in this world to the sceptre of his grace and mercy, they
shall to his iron rod in hell.</p>
<p>The chapter from whence the text is selected is very singular,
yet truly important.&nbsp; The Prophet is led to foretel the base
conduct of the Jews in rejecting the Gospel, the Saviour, and his
Apostles&mdash;the casting away of that nation; the provoking
them to jealousy by a foolish nation, in the calling a people
that did not seek after him, or expect it.&nbsp; These things are
clearly pointed out in the seven first verses.&nbsp; Then, lest
the truly godly should fear being cut off, the Lord graciously
promises he would take care of them, when the rest should be
numbered to the sword; they are the seed, the blessed of the
Lord.&nbsp; A line of distinction is drawn between God&rsquo;s
servants and those rejecters of the Saviour, from the 13th to the
16th verse.&nbsp; The Holy Ghost then leads the mind of the
Prophet to the future glory of the Church in the thousand years
reign&mdash;<i>For behold I create new heavens and a new
earth</i>, which will be a state of joy and comfort.&nbsp; This
new heavens and earth must refer, literally, to the personal
reign of Christ on earth; for the apostle Peter says (it is
written) and to this passage he must refer.&nbsp; After the old
heaven and earth are passed away, then a new region will be
created, suited to the glorified <a name="page8"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 8</span>bodies of the saints&mdash;and a new
earth, where Christ and his saints will dwell personally a
thousand years&mdash;<i>one day with the Lord</i>&mdash;the true
sabbatic year.&nbsp; The Prophet having intimated this, goes on
to shew what will take place previous to this reign, even a
spiritual reign, in the universal knowledge of our
Lord&mdash;long life; no weeping over dead children; no
oppression of each other&rsquo;s houses or lands; but all
temporal prosperity and spiritual success&mdash;speedy answers to
prayer; and even, perhaps, the brute creation will be tamed, and
brought into the same subjection as before the fall&mdash;Hail!
happy period! the Lord hasten it in his time.</p>
<p>This spiritual reign will be very different from the
Millennium, though many good men suppose it the same thing; but
the Millennium will be a perfect state, this will not.&nbsp; The
Millennium will be after the resurrection of the just, this will
be before it.&nbsp; The Millennium will be the personal reign of
Christ, but this will be spiritual; just as it is now, in the
heart&mdash;in the Church, in Doctrines and Ordinances, but with
an amazing increase of light, life, love, and holiness; when, no
doubt, the poorest peasant will have as much light as the apostle
Paul had when on earth.</p>
<p>It is very probable that this prophecy began to take place
upon the spread of the Gospel in the land of Judea, and in the
Gentile world; when <a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>there was a new face of things, so that the whole looked
like a new world.&nbsp; The Gospel ran, had free course, and was
glorified&mdash;Sinners, of every sort and size, were converted
to God&mdash;the Redeemer saw the travail of his soul, and the
Holy Spirit displayed the love, grace, and mercy of God, in all
its glory.&nbsp; The <i>freeness</i> of grace was seen in the
objects it noticed; the <i>power</i> of it was seen in the
conquests it gained; its <i>sovereignty</i> was seen in passing
by those who bid fairest in their own eyes for glory.&nbsp; While
grace revealed these things unto babes, others, not interested in
them, heard enough to hate them&mdash;rejected them altogether,
and persecuted those who had received them.&nbsp; These
persecutions were attended with many advantages to the saints;
none were hurt effectually, nor any bud of the Tree of Life, nor
budding hope, destroyed in all God&rsquo;s holy Mountain.</p>
<p>Thus having proceeded to our text, which I shall barely
comment upon, except the clause I first read as a text, this I
shall endeavor to explain.</p>
<p><i>First</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Wolf shall dwell with the
Lamb</i>&mdash;so it reads in the 11th Chap, of this Book; here
it is the same&mdash;<i>shall feed together</i>; if they dwell
together they must, consequently, feed together.&nbsp; I remark,
that it was the eternal design of God to shew himself to his
creatures as the God of all grace&mdash;so the Apostle words it,
<i>that in the ages to come he might </i><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span><i>shew unto
us the exceeding riches of his grace and kindness towards us</i>,
<i>by Christ Jesus</i>.&nbsp; This he has done in all ages, in
its divine sovereignty, freeness, and power, upon those
characters who may justly be compared to ravening Wolves, who
have worried, and made sad havoc among Christ&rsquo;s
Sheep.&nbsp; Such bitter persecutors have been called out of
darkness into life, the heart being changed, the life and conduct
were changed too; for this is the design and the conquest of
grace.&nbsp; It is to be lamented that many, while in the world,
have been sad opposers of the doctrines of the Gospel&mdash;these
take up a profession, and however promising in appearance, they
still oppose the main Doctrines of the Cross.&nbsp; Then, I ask,
what has grace done for them?&nbsp; In a profession they are, but
in a state of reconciliation they are not.&nbsp; But my text
tells us, that <i>the Wolf and Lamb shall feed
together</i>&mdash;that what the Lambs feed on, such the Wolf
should, when God converted them to the truth.&nbsp; Here the
Saints are compared to Lambs, for their harmlessness and
innocence; and such they are in their new-creature state.&nbsp;
We may see this passage verified in the Apostle Paul&mdash;he was
of the tribe of Benjamin, of whom Jacob said, he should <i>ravin
as a Wolf</i>.&mdash;Thus did Saul of Tarsus against the Sheep of
Jesus.&nbsp; He harrassed, he made sad slaughter among
them.&nbsp; But, oh! the wonders of grace, that tamed, humbled,
and reconciled him to the Saviour and his dear people, that he
laid down at the feet of the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>Lamb of God.&nbsp; He fed with the
Lambs in the same fold, and he was brought to feed them
afterwards.&nbsp; Thus the Wolf and the Lamb fed together; and is
not this true to this hour?&nbsp; Is not the same grace
manifested to us who were, by nature, enemies to the Saviour, his
ministers, and people; as such, to his Doctrines and
Ordinances.&nbsp; We could, perhaps, recollect the time when our
prejudices were strong against these things, but, glory be to
free grace alone, we are changed; now we are never happy but at
the feet of Jesus, and feeding on him, his Word, and in his
Ordinances, the food on which we live, and which I shall speak of
at the close of this Subject.</p>
<p><i>Secondly</i>.&nbsp; This Promise may refer to the two
natures in every Believer, <i>Sin</i> and <i>Grace</i>.&nbsp; The
sinful nature of the Believer is not changed&mdash;<i>that which
is born of the flesh is flesh</i>&mdash;it will be a Wolf all its
days; though it may be kept in, by almighty grace, through deep
trials and sore conflicts; yet, every Believer is, in his New
Man, Lamb-like, though often worried by the Wolf of his own
corruptions.&nbsp; Yet these must dwell together till death;
these walk, these rise up, and lie down together; this is our
plague, out affliction, and distress; and though we are condemned
as lovers of sin, we can assure our foes we should be glad to get
rid of it.&nbsp; Sin a burthen to the New Man; so we feel
it.&nbsp; This sinful nature feeds on earth, and every <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>thing that is
contrary to God; but the New Man only on the great things of
God.</p>
<p><i>Thirdly</i>.&nbsp; May not this refer to the State of the
Church of God, which is at present in her imperfect state; not
only in her feelings, but plagued with those who are only
hypocrites in Zion, Tares among the Wheat, Sheep among the Goats,
and Wolves in Sheep&rsquo;s cloathing.&nbsp; This is the sad
state of the Saints; at times they are ready to cry out with Job,
<i>Let not the hypocrite reign</i>, <i>lest the souls of the
righteous be ensnared</i>.&nbsp; And, with the Apostles,
<i>Lord</i>, <i>shall we root them up</i>?&nbsp; But no; these
Wise and Foolish Virgins must be together till the Midnight Cry
is made, then there will be an happy but awful separation; but
these dwell together now, in the same Church, at the same table;
sit in the same seat; look just the same as the Saints; claim the
same Promises, and boast the same light; talk of what they never
felt, and in full, tho&rsquo; daring and presumptuous confidence,
are, in their own esteem, going to the same glory.&nbsp; Hence
God complains of them, <i>Ezek.</i> xxxiii, 30, <i>Also thou Son
of Man</i>, <i>the children of thy people are still talking
against thee</i>, <i>by the walls and in the doors of the
houses</i>&mdash;(how true have I found this?)&mdash;<i>and they
come unto thee as my people cometh</i>, <i>and they sit before
thee as my people</i>, <i>and they hear thy words</i>, <i>but do
them not</i>; <i>and lo</i>, <i>thou art to them as a very lovely
song</i>, <i>of one that hath a pleasant voice</i>, <i>and can
play </i><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span><i>well upon an instrument</i>, <i>for they hear thy
words but they do them not</i>.&nbsp; Doing them is
believing&mdash;receiving the truth in the love of it; and by
experience, proving the truths we preach.&nbsp; There are Wolves
that are in Sheep&rsquo;s clothing&mdash;these feed upon
<i>sounds</i>, but the Lambs upon <i>substance</i>.&mdash;Under
another metaphor we shall point out the <i>food</i> of such
Wolves and Goats&mdash;they are distinct from the Sheep, and will
be found so in the last great day.&nbsp; See 25th of
<i>Matthew&rsquo;s</i> Gospel.</p>
<p>The second part of the text may likewise be considered in a
double sense, good and bad.&nbsp; As most metaphorical passages
are controvertible, and will apply to a variety of cases, so in
this, <i>The Lion shall eat Straw like the Bullock</i>&mdash;in
the 11th Chap. it is said like the <i>Ox</i>; and as the Prophet
is predicting the success of the Gospel in the days of the
Messiah, or the latter day glory.&nbsp; It may refer to the
conversion of some of the great ones of our globe&mdash;kings;
and such there have been, and such there shall yet be, when kings
shall become nursing fathers to the Church, and queens nursing
mothers.&nbsp; Hence the Chaldean, Assyrian, and Persian
conquerors are called Lions, <i>Dan</i>. vii, <i>And four great
beasts came up from the sea</i>, <i>the first was like a
Lion</i>.&nbsp; <i>The Lion hath roared</i>, <i>who will not
fear</i>? <i>the Lion did tear in pieces</i>.&nbsp; <i>And he
cried a Lion</i>, <i>my Lord</i>&mdash;<i>the Lion is come up
from his thicket</i>, <a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span><i>and the destroyer of the Gentiles
is on his way</i>.&mdash;Thus great tyrannical oppressors, kings,
mighty men, are called Lions.&nbsp; Some of these have been
tamed, humbled, and fed with the useful, laborious patient Oxen,
by whom we may understand Ministers of the Gospel.&nbsp; <i>Thou
shalt not muzzle the Ox</i>.&nbsp; <i>Doth God take care of
Oxen</i>? <i>or saith he it for our sakes</i>? <i>for our
sakes</i>, <i>doubtless</i>, saith Paul, who calls Himself one of
them, in common with his fellow-labourers&mdash;<i>our
sakes</i>.</p>
<p>Some great men have been called, witness Manasseh, the
proudest and most awful character that ever lived; and no doubt
many more have experienced the power of divine grace bringing
them into the Church of Jesus.&nbsp; These have helped kindly to
support the Gospel ministry&mdash;these have fed with the
ministers of the word&mdash;this, perhaps, will be better seen
another day, when the ten kings shall have their hearts turned to
hate the diabolical system of Popery; stall hate the Whore; eat
her flesh; obtain a victory over her, and burn her with
fire.&nbsp; Then God&rsquo;s Two Witnesses shall, in the best
sense, stand up for the truth&mdash;even the Magistracy and the
Ministry, Kings and Preachers; and what will they not
effect?&nbsp; This may be seen it the 15th of <i>Revelation</i>,
when the Angels will go forth with their vials, their breasts
girded with golden girdles, and clothed in robes of
righteousness, truth and faithfulness.&nbsp; See the 17th Chap.
of the <i>Revelation</i>, <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>60th of <i>Isaiah</i>, and 15th of
<i>Revelation</i>.&nbsp; Thus the Lion shall eat Straw like the
Bullock.</p>
<p>But, <i>Secondly</i>, It may be considered in an awful sense,
to which I rather incline, because it does not say they shall lie
down together, nor that they shall eat the green pastures of
Christ, but <i>straw</i>.&nbsp; It may signify a person who has
heard the Gospel and rejected it, to whom it has become the
savour of death unto death.&nbsp; These may become fierce and
cruel opposers of the Gospel; the worst opposers, as they attempt
to stab religion in its vitals.&nbsp; These are called by the
Apostle, the <i>Adversaries</i>, who have scorned the Saviour,
despised his blood, and opposed his truths.&nbsp; Witness some
that have heard the Gospel, and once professed all the truth, who
have since turned Deists, Arians, Socinians, Muggletonians, and
Sabellians, and are now wickedly and spitefully using all their
arguments and influence against the truth, and to deceive
souls.&nbsp; These Lions are coupled with the Bullock in the
text; by whom we may understand Persecutors.&nbsp; Hence our Lord
explains, <i>Fat Bulls of Bashan enclose me in on every
side</i>.&nbsp; David prays, <i>Rebuke the company of
Spearmen</i>, <i>the multitude of the Bulls</i>, <i>with the
Calves of the People</i>.&nbsp; And God, by Isaiah, threatens
them in tremendous language&mdash;Chap. xxxiv. 7.</p>
<p><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>These
characters are said to eat <i>straw</i>&mdash;by which we may
understand the refuse of the Lord&rsquo;s floor; not Wheat, but
Chaff, Stubble, and Straw, fit fuel for fire&mdash;who must, and
will be driven out of the Church, the Barn Floor&mdash;whose fan
is in his hand, and he will thoroughly purge his Floor&mdash;he
will burn up the chaff with fire!&nbsp; These hypocrites,
Apostates, Imposters, and their errors, are the delight of such
characters, and God has coupled them together, in the 1st Chapter
of <i>Isaiah</i>&mdash;<i>And the destruction of the
transgressors and of the sinners shall be together</i>; <i>and
they that forsake the Lord shall be consumed</i>.&nbsp; Thus the
Lion shall eat Straw like the Bullock.</p>
<p>I come now to that part of the verse I first read.&nbsp; I
shall consider, <i>First</i>, the
<i>Serpent</i>&mdash;<i>Secondly</i>, the <i>Food</i> that is
appointed him.&nbsp; <i>Dust </i><span
class="GutSmall"><i>SHALL</i></span><i> be the Serpent&rsquo;s
meat</i>.</p>
<p><i>First</i>, The <i>Serpent</i>, absolutely and
figuratively.&mdash;The word Serpent, in Scripture, means, First,
Naturally the creature itself.&nbsp; <i>Now the Serpent was more
subtil than any beast of the Field</i>.&mdash;Secondly, A
miraculous one, as Moses&rsquo; Rod was turned into a
Serpent.&mdash;Third, A delusive one, or one in shew.&nbsp;
<i>The Magicians cast their Rods on the ground</i>, <i>and they
became Serpents</i>.&nbsp; Fourth, An artificial one.&nbsp;
<i>Moses made a Serpent of Brass</i>.&nbsp; But sometimes it
signifies the Devil&mdash;hence he is <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>called that Old Serpent.&nbsp; And
sometimes the enemies of Jesus and his People&mdash;<i>Ye
Serpents</i>! <i>ye generation of Vipers</i>!&nbsp; <i>How can ye
escape the damnation of Hell</i>?&nbsp; Satan is called a
Serpent, because he hid himself in the Serpent in his first
stratagem against our first Patents.&nbsp; Because of his
serpentine disposition, in his poison and malice against Christ
and his Church; and in his winding, by his flattery, craftiness,
and his accursed condition.&mdash;The first account we have of
him is very early.&nbsp; Originally created in light, he envied
the honors paid the adorable Trinity; or he envied the Lord Jesus
Christ the glory he was to obtain as God-Man.&nbsp; He
disbelieved the eternal power and faithfulness of God.&nbsp; He
drew millions of angels into rebellion with him.&nbsp; He abode
not in the truth; for which he was cast in the prison of
Hell.&nbsp; His sin seems to be an awful complication of pride,
envy, and unbelief.&nbsp; Cast out of bliss; held in the chains
of darkness, he is permitted to wander like a vagabond and thief,
to fill up the measure of his iniquity.&nbsp; Permitted to enter
the Garden of Eden, where the image of Christ was, even Adam, who
was made in that image our dear Lord intended to assume.&nbsp;
Satan envied him his bliss; hated the image of God, and adopted a
plan to overturn it.&nbsp; He selected out the most subtil beast
God had formed, and through it he addressed our Mother, in artful
and insinuating language.&nbsp; He temped her with the lust of
the eye; she saw the tree was <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>good.&nbsp; With the pride of
life&mdash;<i>Ye shall be as gods</i>, <i>knowing good and
evil</i>.&nbsp; This was done in the form of the Serpent&mdash;so
that the Devil and his agents have gone by this name ever
since.&nbsp; We will quote the passage, and make a few remarks on
it, which will lead us to understand what is meant by the Serpent
and his Food.&nbsp; <i>Gen.</i> iii. <i>Now the Serpent was more
subtil than any beast of the field</i>&mdash;and having seduced
our Parents, when the Lord appeared to them, they laid the blame
on him.&nbsp; Then in the 14th verse, the Lord God said unto the
Serpent, <i>Because thou hast done this thou art cursed above all
cattle</i>, <i>and every beast of the field</i>.&nbsp; <i>Upon
thy belly shall thou go</i>, <i>and dust shalt thou eat all the
days of thy life</i>.&nbsp; <i>And I will put enmity between thee
and the Woman</i>, <i>and between thy seed and her
seed</i>&mdash;<i>he shall bruise thy head</i>, <i>and thou shalt
bruise his heel</i>.&mdash;Thus runs the curse upon the
Serpent.</p>
<p>I humbly offer my opinion, that this curse did not fall upon
that creature in general; though no doubt the Serpent that was
the agent received the curse of God.&nbsp; But that Satan was the
character is evident, as he is in full possession of the curse to
this hour.</p>
<p><i>Josephus</i> was of opinion that till this curse was
denounced the Serpent went erect, and had the use of speech like
man; and this opinion is still received <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>among
many&mdash;the Scriptures are silent upon it.&mdash;Our English
Poet, <i>John Milton</i>, speaks in very striking terms,
probably, though, in general, conjecturally.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;So spake the enemy of mankind,
inclos&rsquo;d<br />
In Serpent, inmate bad! and toward Eve<br />
Address&rsquo;d his way: not with indented wave,<br />
Prone on the ground, as <i>since</i>; but on his rear,<br />
Circular base of rising folds, that tower&rsquo;d<br />
Fold above fold, a surging maze!&nbsp; His head<br />
Crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes;<br />
With burnish&rsquo;d neck of verdant gold erect,<br />
Amidst his circling spires, that on the grass<br />
Floated abundant; pleasing was his shape<br />
And lovely&mdash;never since, of Serpent kind,<br />
Lovelier.&nbsp; He, uncall&rsquo;d, before her stood<br />
The eye of Eve to mark his play; he, glad<br />
Of her attention gain&rsquo;d with Serpent tongue<br />
Organic, or impulse of vocal air,<br />
His fraudulent temptation then began.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mr. <i>Allen</i> observes, on the clause, <i>On thy belly
shalt thou go</i>&mdash;that the Serpent, before it was concerned
in seducing our first Parents, went erect, or upright; which
shews they have still some of their original nature in them, for
they will now erect themselves upon the hinder part of their
bodies, and go a considerable way in that position.&nbsp; The
truly-excellent Dr. <i>Gill&rsquo;s</i> remarks, I think, excel
all I ever read.</p>
<p><i>Yet now the Serpent was more subtil than any </i><a
name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span><i>beast of
the field which the Lord God had made</i>.&mdash;Many instances
are given of the subtilty of Serpents, in hiding their heads when
struck at; rolling themselves up; stopping their ear at the voice
of the charmer; putting off their skin; lying in sand of the same
colour as themselves; biting the feet of horses; and many such
things.&nbsp; But it does not appear now to be more subtil than
many other creatures, whatever it might be when first
created.&mdash;The words therefore may be rendered, <i>That
Serpent</i>, <i>that particular Serpent</i>, was made more subtil
than any beast of the field&mdash;not naturally, but through
Satan being in it; for though a real Serpent, yet not that only,
but as possessed and used by Satan, as an instrument of his, to
accomplish his designs, as evident from its having the faculty of
speech and the use of reason, employed in a very artful and
sophistic manner.&nbsp; Nor is it rational to suppose that human
nature, in the height of its glory and excellency, should be
out-witted by a creature so inferior to it.&nbsp; The Scripture
always alledges the fall of man to the seduction of the Devil,
who, on that account, is called the Serpent, the old Serpent, the
Devil and Satan.&nbsp; <i>He said unto the Woman</i>.&nbsp; She
being alone, he took the advantage of it&mdash;not the Serpent,
but Satan in it, just as the Angel spoke in <i>Balaam&rsquo;s</i>
Ass.</p>
<p>It is very probable that good Angels appeared in Paradise to
our first Parents, in one form or another, <a
name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>and conversed
with them&mdash;it may be in human forms, and it may be in the
form of a beautiful flying Serpent, which looked very bright and
shining, and that sort called the Seraph.&nbsp; Hence angels bear
the name of Seraphim, as some have thought; so that it might not
be at all surprising to Eve to hear the Serpent speak, it being
what she might have been used to hear, and might take it to be a
good angel sent to her with a message from God.</p>
<p>Good Matthew Henry remarks upon the Passage, that the Devil
chose to act his part in a Serpent, because it is a specious
creature, has a spotted dappled skin, and then went erect.&nbsp;
Perhaps it was a flying Serpent, which seemed to come as a
messenger from the upper world&mdash;one of the Seraphim, for the
fiery Serpents were flying&mdash;<i>Isaiah</i> xv, 29.&nbsp; Many
a gay temptation comes to us in fine colours, which are but skin
deep, and appears to come from above, for Satan can seem an angel
of light.</p>
<p>The learned Witsius remarks, He who seduced man to this
apostasy was doubtless a wicked spirit, who, tormented with the
horrors of a guilty conscience, envied man his happiness in God,
and God the pleasure he had in man.&nbsp; Seeking wretched
consolation in a partaker of his misery, he concealed himself,
therefore, in the Serpent, which was at that time not less
acceptable to man than any other <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>creature.&nbsp; The great Du Moulin
conjectures this Serpent was of a conspicuous form, with fiery
eyes; decked with gold, and marked with shining spots, such as to
draw the eyes of Eve after it; and that before this, he had, by
his soothing sounds, insinuated himself into Eve&rsquo;s
favour&mdash;which is very probable.</p>
<p>The present learned Dr. Clarke conjectures this creature was
an Ape instead of a Serpent; but the arguments he brings forward
are by no means sufficient to support the fact.&nbsp; The form of
the curse pronounced on Satan, in the Serpent, is, <i>Now thou
art cursed above all cattle</i>, <i>and above every beast of the
field</i>.&nbsp; This curse has not fallen upon that species of
animals, called the Serpent, in general, though it might on that
particular one which Satan made use of; for there are various
kinds of Serpents, or creatures of the Serpent kind&mdash;the
reeded Serpent, the fiery flying Serpent, the horned Serpent, the
Basilisk, the Dragon, the Deaf Adder, the common Adder, the
Viper, the Asp, the Water Snake, the Land Snake, the
Rattle-Snake, the Conger Eel, the common Eel, and the
Lamprey&mdash;these are of the Serpent kind.&nbsp; Now the
Serpent the Devil abused was but one, but of what kind we know
not, and the sentence of God is in the singular number&mdash;so
Dr. Gill remarks, <i>that</i> Serpent&mdash;on thy belly shalt
<i>thou</i> go, and dust shalt <i>thou</i> eat all the days of
thy life.&nbsp; So that as far as the curse <a
name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>went on the
agent, when that one Serpent died the sentence was fully executed
on that creature.&nbsp; But the curse, in all its dreadful
weight, fell on the Devil, who is cursed above all sinners, who
are called cattle, Beasts, and the unclean&mdash;as Lions, Dogs,
Bears, Rams, Wolves, Leopards, Bulls, Heifers at grass, Foxes,
and Goats.&nbsp; Many of these have been tamed, become useful and
tractable, but Devils never were, nor never will; and Satan, the
ring-leader, I apprehend is cursed above them all&mdash;<i>upon
thy belly shalt thou go</i>.&nbsp; What the learned have said
about the Serpent&rsquo;s going erect is bare conjecture.&nbsp;
But this curse is evidently upon the Devil: the word Belly in
scripture, sometimes signifies the Conscience, and I believe it
means this: Hence Job speaking of the seed of the Serpent, says,
<i>they shall not feel quietness in the Belly</i>&mdash;it means
depression and deep abasement, in awful affliction&mdash;our
belly cleaveth to the ground, our soul is bowed down to the
dust.&nbsp; This is what Satan feels, and will be cursed with for
ever&mdash;no ease or rest, but hell in him wherever he
goes&mdash;God&rsquo;s curse and wrath upon him&mdash;the arrows
of vindictive wrath sticking fast in him; nor can he feel any
joy, only that kind of malicious infernal pleasure, suited to his
nature, as he draws men to sin against God&mdash;especially
believers.</p>
<p>The term Serpent not only applies to the Devil, <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>but to his
people&mdash;the non-elect, the reprobate; more particularly to
those Pharisees, who make a fair shew in the flesh&mdash;a noise
about holiness, and who are endeavoring to establish their
reputation upon the ruin of others&mdash;who are searching for
the sins of others, and they search for iniquity with a diligent
search&mdash;who keep up the form of godliness, are found in
every external, yet in heart hate the saints, condemn them, as
enemies to good works&mdash;as Antinomians&mdash;enemies
Moses&mdash;as a people not fit to live, of course not to come
near them.&mdash;These characters are called Serpents, and a
generation of Vipers; not only so themselves but their parents
were so, and they are the offspring of such Vipers; and so we
find it to this day&mdash;a deistical Preacher begets Deists, a
Socinian begets such, an Arian begets an Arian, an Arminian
begets an Arminian by his ministry, and an Antinomian, whose
religion lays in his head, without the Work of the Spirit, such
may beget an offspring like themselves, while every Pharisee in
the Ministry may also beget the same; but the name John the
Baptist gave them is a generation of Vipers, when he saw the
Pharisees come to his Baptism.&nbsp; A Viper appears very
beautiful outwardly, so do these persons to a blind, carnal
world, who are making a stir about good works, and, like
Alexander Pope, are exclaiming,</p>
<blockquote><p>For Modes of Faith let zealous bigots fight,<br />
His can&rsquo;t be wrong whose life is in the right.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>But, I
would ask, Can a man&rsquo;s life be in the right when all his
principles are bad?&nbsp; Vipers, inwardly full of malice,
hatred, envy, bitterness, and evil speaking; it looks innocent,
as if it could harm nobody, but, under the garb of religion,
holiness, and morality, what will such characters not do?&nbsp;
The Redeemer calls such by the same name John did, in Matt. xii,
and then in Chap. xxiii, <i>Ye Serpents</i>, <i>ye generation of
Vipers</i>, <i>how can ye escape the damnation of hell</i>?&nbsp;
Fair in speech and shew, but cruel and dangerous; with many such
as these we have had to combat, who are of their father the
Devil, and the desires of their father they do.</p>
<p>But the decree runs, <i>And dust shall be the Serpent&rsquo;s
meat</i>.&nbsp; This is only renewing the curse upon Satan and
his seed, which was first pronounced in the Garden of Eden.&nbsp;
Good men have differed a little upon the food of the Serpent;
some suppose that before the fall he lived upon the fruits of the
Garden, but afterwards that he was only to eat dust.&nbsp;
Perhaps this was the case with that one Serpent the Devil made
use of, but it certainly is not true of Serpents in
general.&nbsp; Others think it means, that in consequence of the
curse, <i>upon thy belly thou shalt go</i>, that they should eat
much dust with their food; this may be the case in part, but not
universally.&nbsp; Many keep Serpents in the kingdom of Abyssinia
for the purpose of divination, as Mr. Bruce tells us in his
Travels, and they feed them <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>with white bread and milk, which
there are very fond of.</p>
<p>Mr. Toplady justly remarks on this passage, that what is said
of the Serpent going on his belly and eating dust, are properties
common to many kinds of vermin, such as worms, &amp;c.&mdash;and
why should that be esteemed a curse to the Serpent which is
natural to many other animals beside.&nbsp; But is it so said
because this creature is obnoxious to man? so are many others
beside, and it is worthy observation, that there are some kind of
Serpents which are remarkable for the affection they bear to man;
and others are good for food, and have been served up as such,
even at royal tables.</p>
<p>The words then must refer to something mystic and
spiritual.&nbsp; The phrase, <i>Dust shalt thou eat</i>, implies
a state of absolute subjection, for so it signifies in
scripture&mdash;<i>his enemies shall lick the dust</i>; <i>they
shall lick dust like a Serpent</i>&mdash;<i>they shall bow down
to the earthy and lick up the dust of thy feet</i>.&nbsp; These
enemies shall be totally vanquished and subdued, and lie at the
feet of the conqueror.</p>
<p>By the dust that the Serpent is to eat is meant sinners
against the most high, living and dying enemies to God, Father,
Son, and Spirit&mdash;enemies to truth and the seed of God.&nbsp;
This I think is clear from the declaration <i>I will put enmity
between thy </i><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span><i>seed and her seed</i>, the seed of the Serpent.&nbsp;
This is the dust he is to eat; this is his curse.&nbsp; These
persons are the Serpent&rsquo;s prey, and the dust he shall
devour.&nbsp; The phrase of Satan eating, denotes the hellish
pleasure he takes in man&rsquo;s ruin; for a person is supposed
to eat nothing but what he loves; it is the Devil&rsquo;s meat,
his joy, his delight, to lead into sin, to get men to serve him,
and to buffet, vex, and plague the saints.</p>
<p>The learned Fagius observes, Satan is a spirit, and must
therefore require immaterial food; which can be nothing else but
the sins of men, on which he feeds with pleasure.</p>
<p>St. Augustine says, By dust, Sinners are meant; so that
sinners are given him for his prey.&nbsp; If then we would not be
his food, we must not be earthly minded.</p>
<p>St. Ambrose says, that by dust we are to understand the flesh
of men, on which God permits Satan to feed, that is, sometimes to
torment and grieve the bodies of believers, for over their souls
he has not the least command.&nbsp; The dust, therefore, Satan
eats, is the seed spoken of as the seed of the Serpent; these are
called the cattle, and the beasts of the field&mdash;these are
Satan&rsquo;s portion, bear his image, and will be found like him
another day, even in the resurrection of the wicked&mdash;<i>When
they </i><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span><i>shall awake</i>, <i>O Lord</i>, <i>thou wilt despise
their image</i>.&nbsp; All the sins, infirmities, temptations,
and troubles, of God&rsquo;s dear people&mdash;these are the dust
he feeds on.&nbsp; And as it is with the father Serpent, it is
with his seed; his offspring a generation of Vipers and Serpents,
they have their portion of dust to eat, and they can feed on
nothing else&mdash;and this every believer has seen to his
grief.&nbsp; What in one scripture is called the seed of the
Serpent, is in another called the children of the wicked
one.&nbsp; First, Because as sinners, they are his
offspring.&nbsp; Secondly, Because they are like him, and bear
the same names, a liar, a Lion, a Serpent, a destroyer, and an
enemy; and because they bear his image, do his works, and obey
his commands; their food is alike&mdash;dust is their meat as
well as his.</p>
<p>This is another point we shall discover&mdash;Man having lost
the image of God, left the fountain of his bliss and
satisfaction; his mind soon became vitiated&mdash;a vacancy being
in it he seeks to fill the empty space with any thing, and every
thing but God.&nbsp; This is the state of every man by nature;
this the believer can remember with regret, and can now look back
on his former folly in forsaking the fountain and cleaving to the
stream of creature satisfaction.&nbsp; Changed by grace, he views
his fellow immortals seeking for that which will never satisfy
him.&nbsp; The Miser, a poor grovelling Serpent, feeding on white
and yellow dust, &ldquo;Throwing up his <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>interest in
both worlds&mdash;first starv&rsquo;d in this, then damn&rsquo;d
in that to come.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Blair</i>.&nbsp; He heapeth up
riches, and cannot tell who shall gather
them.&mdash;<i>David</i>.&nbsp; He layeth up silver as the
Dust&mdash;the pant after the dust of the earth.</p>
<p>Thus such Serpents eat the dust, while their covetous hearts
are perpetually crying, &ldquo;Give!&nbsp;
Give!&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Solomon</i>.&nbsp; &ldquo;They grudge, and
are not satisfied.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>David</i>.&nbsp; All the vain
pursuits, carnal gratifications, sensual delights, and that
phantom, called Pleasure, which a worldling strives for, is but
trying to fill the mind with dust.&nbsp; Hence the Prophet Isaiah
represents them as a people dreaming&mdash;<i>They have been
eating and drinking</i>, <i>and when they awake up</i>, <i>behold
they are hungry</i>.&mdash;Isaiah xxix.&nbsp; Hence David prays,
<i>And let me not eat of their dainties</i>.&nbsp; For all that
is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the
pride of life&mdash;these are not of the Father, but of the
world&mdash;these are ashes; and the dust they feed on&mdash;1
John ii.</p>
<p>Men of a persecuting spirit, whose hearts rise against God,
religion, and the dear Saviour, the Work of the Spirit, and all
Saints&mdash;these are said to feed on the Saints; they are well
pleased at every species of persecution; <i>they eat up my people
as they eat bread</i>, <i>and call not upon God</i>.&nbsp;
<i>When my foes came upon me to eat up my flesh</i>, <i>they
</i><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span><i>stumbled and fell</i>.&nbsp; Hence David prays,
<i>Deliver me from the men who are thy sword</i>, <i>O Lord</i>,
<i>whose belly thou fillest with thy hid treasures</i>.&nbsp;
Thus, like Satan, they wait to eat, to devour, to destroy the
Lord&rsquo;s people, who are called dust.&nbsp; &ldquo;I that am
but dust and ashes, have taken upon me to speak to the
Lord.&rdquo;&mdash;<i>Abraham</i>. &ldquo;Who can number the dust
of Jacob?&nbsp; Thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and
favor the dust thereof.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Erroneous characters, who have been in a profession of the
truth, and who have left it and turned again like a washed swine
to the mire; who have taken seven other spirits, far worse than
before they heard the Gospel.&nbsp; These persons are
industriously circulating errors; trying to make such kind of
proselytes, who are two-fold more the children of hell than they
were before.&nbsp; Such characters are Serpents and Vipers, make
a fair shew, to deceive and to damn immortal souls: they talk
about the universal goodness of God&mdash;too good to consign any
man to perdition: they argue for an universal salvation; and that
if any man should be lost, he will be restored again: they argue
against the sovereignty of God, in the Doctrine of Election and
divine Predestination&mdash;against one being taken and another
left&mdash;against the Obedience of Christ, as our justifying
righteousness&mdash;against the Divinity of the Son, or the
Spirit: they level their artillery against the Trinity in
Unity&mdash;against the high priviledges <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of
God&rsquo;s Elect&mdash;against the Fundamentals of the Gospel;
and this to deceive the simple and unwary.&nbsp; Hence such are
described as an whore, in the Book of the Proverbs: <i>She
eateth</i> (that is enjoyeth these deceptions and awful
delusions) <i>and saith</i>, <i>I have done no
wickedness</i>.&mdash;Proverbs xxxi.&nbsp; <i>Ephraim feedeth on
ashes</i>; <i>a deceived heart hath turned him aside</i>; <i>he
cannot deliver his soul</i>, <i>nor say is there not a lie in my
right hand</i>.&nbsp; This is the Serpent&rsquo;s meat, and if
grace does not prevent it, they must have the Serpent&rsquo;s
portion&mdash;a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
indignation, which shall devour the <i>Adversaries</i>.</p>
<p>Pharisees.&mdash;These are of different kinds, and under
various orders&mdash;some in a profession of gospel truth, sit
under its sound, obey its external precepts as far as it relates
to bodily exercise; others are inimical to the very sound of it
altogether, yet pride themselves upon following the religion they
were brought up in; that they are as good as they wish to be, and
not half so bad as their neighbours.&nbsp; Thus in heart they are
all alike; those in a profession and those out of it, are all
upon a level.&nbsp; The Gospel Pharisees thank God they are not
so bad as those vile Antinomians, who talk about free grace, and
perform no works.&nbsp; Others thank God they are not quite so
bad, nor indeed nothing like, other people; they have good
hearts, they mean well and <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>wish well to all.&nbsp; Hence our
dear Lord spake a parable to those who trusted in themselves that
they were righteous, and despised others.&nbsp; The Pharisee
stood, and prayed, <i>God I thank thee I am not as other
men</i>&mdash;so they vainly think, and so they declare: their
works are of themselves; they wear Spider&rsquo;s webs, they make
a covering, but not of God&rsquo;s Spirit; they are stretching
themselves upon a bed which is too short, and so all will find
who reject the plan of salvation, by Jesus alone.&mdash;These
make a noise about holiness, and good works&mdash;these sound a
trumpet and proclaim their own goodness; and they have their
reward&mdash;this is but sounding brass and the tinkling of a
cymbal&mdash;it is feeding on wind; all the works they do, are to
be seen of men: but the Saviour says to his disciples, <i>Be ye
not like to them</i>.&nbsp; These will give nothing away, without
their names are published, printed, or put up in the front of an
alms house, or on the walls of a church or hospital&mdash;on
these things they feed&mdash;a good name among men; a refutation
in the world: this is the foundation of their hope, and this is
said to be in dust&mdash;<i>His foundation is in the dust</i>;
<i>but the hail will sweep away their refuge of lies</i>, <i>and
the waters will overflow their hiding places</i>, what they build
on, that they enjoy; and thus dust is their meat&mdash;and if
they do not absolutely declare that all their hopes are laid on
what they do, they conclude their good works will either help
forward their salvation, or are grand essences of
it&mdash;whereas <a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>nothing that the brightest saint can do, externally, is
any evidence of his new birth, none at all; for any man,
destitute of divine teaching can do the same.&nbsp; He may hear,
read, commune, speak well, relieve the poor, and be found in
every external ordinance; so says Isaiah xlviii, and Ezekiel
xxiii.&nbsp; And should this little Pamphlet fall into the hands
of any man or woman, who has been building on such evidences, I
pray God that the scales may drop from their eyes, that they may
see their danger, and be brought, as poor sinners, to the Lord
Christ for all they want.</p>
<p>The performances of persons who are destitute of the grace of
God, are called the Works of the Law; whereas it is not so
properly, for they are ignorant of the Law, nor does the Law call
for any such Works; therefore they are but the Works of the
flesh, and those who feed on them are eating dust, whether they
are in a profession or not.&nbsp; Hence God threaten his enemies
that he will send them the <i>Poison of Serpents of the
dust</i>.&nbsp; Deut xxxii.&nbsp; And when he takes a sinner in
hand, he is said to <i>scrape her dust from her</i>.&mdash;Ezek.
xxvi; then he kindly invites, <i>Come now</i>, <i>let us reason
together</i>&mdash;and, graciously promises, <i>though your sins
be as scarlet they shall be as wool</i>, <i>and though they be
red like crimson they shall be whiter than snow</i>; <i>and I
will surely purge away thy dross</i>, <i>and take away thy
tin</i>.&nbsp; Isaiah i.&nbsp; This is the Work of God <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>and this must
be done if ever we see the face of God with joy; we must be
stripped of all supposed goodness, and emptied of self before we
can be filled with the Saviour.</p>
<p>When the excellent Toplady had finished his Sermon on
Justification, pious Lady Huntingdon said to him, &ldquo;Sir, I
think you gave the Pharisees a good dressing to
night.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh, Madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I
did not want to dress them, but I aimed to undress
them:&rdquo;&mdash;and sure I am that our filthy garments of
self-righteousness must be taken away, before we can enjoy the
change of raiment.&nbsp; <i>Zech.</i> iii.&nbsp; Till this is the
case with us we may cry out, with the tongue (and if not, every
Pharisee exclaims, practically) <i>Stand by thyself</i>.&nbsp;
<i>I am holier than thou</i>!&nbsp; But, from all such blindness,
hardness of heart, and contempt of God&rsquo;s Word and
Commandment, Good Lord deliver us.</p>
<p>The food of the hypocrite, which the Swine did eat, these are
called husks.&nbsp; Hence our dear Lord, by a Parable,
represented his own people in a backsliding state, trying to fill
their souls with husks, a form of godliness without the power,
the sound without the substance, the shell without the
kernel.&nbsp; So it is written in Luke xv.&nbsp; <i>And there
arose a mighty famine in the land</i>, <i>and he began to be in
want</i>, <i>and he joined himself to a citizen of that
country</i>, <i>and he sent him out to feed Swine</i>, <a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span><i>and he
fain would have filled his belly with the husks that the Swine
did eat</i>.&nbsp; Here is an awakened soul, with spiritual life,
guilt, and shame in his conscience, flying to a false refuge to
make up what had been amiss; and obeying the orders of a false
teacher, without looking to Jesus as his only refuge.</p>
<p>When a poor sinner first comes into a profession, he is full
of legality, and being full of sin and darkness, he generally
flies to those kind of preachers that will set him to work; and
these commonly argue with such poor sinners, &ldquo;Why, as you
have done so much against God, it is now high time you did
something for God.&rdquo;&nbsp; This sounds well in the ears of
such, and to work they go, to try to please God; and if the
Preacher does not immediately send them to the Moral Law, they
are generally sent to some tradition of the Elders; they must
become teachers in the Sunday Schools; they must form a Society
and visit the Sick; they must attend upon Prayer Meetings and
other religious Societies.&nbsp; Here those who have no spiritual
life can rest; upon these husks they can feed; but where there is
real hungering and thirsting after the bread of life, the mind
cannot be fed with such things; not but that they are
praise-worthy in themselves, but they should not be carried on by
souls in such a state, their place is to wait at the door of
mercy; to be in spiritual labour to get the bread of life, and
having found him, then to observe their call in Providence <a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>to visit
others.&nbsp; But many are at this work all their days, and will
be found with no other title or qualification for glory but
this.&nbsp; When death comes, then they will, perhaps, have to
reflect with pleasure on the use they have been to others.&nbsp;
But this will be a miserable foundation; and if they do not
expect salvation upon this ground, yet they must confess they
have looked upon these things as fruits and evidences; but
eternity will convince them they are not the fruits of the
Spirit.&nbsp; Hypocrite and Pharisees can feed here, but a
quickened soul cannot; this every truly converted character must
acknowledge.&nbsp; Those hypocritical professors not only feed on
these eternals, but on the failings, sins, and falls, either real
or supposed, of God&rsquo;s people, every fall they hear of is
marrow and fatness to them: these they sweetly enjoy, quite
forgeting that they cannot be said to fall themselves, for, as
they never stood, either by faith or love, they cannot fall; they
have but few temptations, and those only what a worldly man has,
and not what is peculiar to God&rsquo;s elect.&nbsp; Hence the
Apostle says, Let him that <i>thinketh</i> he standeth&mdash;he
only thinks so, yet he may fall from his profession altogether;
and as he exulted in the supposed falls of the saints, God may
cast him down from his excellency.&nbsp; I have often observed
this myself, and the sacred Scriptures strikingly set it forth;
<i>the net they spread for others</i>, <i>the pit they have
digged they have been taken in</i>; so God has always testified,
sooner or later, as it is <a name="page37"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 37</span>written, He that rolleth a stone it
shall turn upon him, and he that diggeth a pit shall fall
therein.&mdash;He that cleaveth wood shall be endangered
thereby.&nbsp; Read the 10th of <i>Eccles.</i> from the 8th to
the 15th verse.</p>
<p>The Food of the Serpent is said to be
<i>Lies</i>&mdash;<i>Hosea</i> x, 13, <i>Ye have eaten
lies</i>&mdash;this is that kind of food which suits their
vitiated taste.&nbsp; The same Prophet declares, They eat up the
sin of my people; they set their hearts on their iniquity, for
they shall eat and not have enough.&mdash;<i>Hosea</i> iv, 8, 9,
10.&mdash;The private injury done to others is called <i>Bread
eaten in secret places</i>&mdash;and such eaters are like
Pharaoh&rsquo;s lean kine, none the better for all they have
devoured.&nbsp; They are said to eat up the flesh of God&rsquo;s
people, <i>Psalm</i> xxvii, 2; and their lying words,
back-biting, whisperings, envies, hatred, gossiping, and evil
speaking, their running from house to house with tales against
others, their secret and outward triumph in all they can get
against others, whether true or false&mdash;the whole of such
conduct demonstrates a serpentine disposition, feeding on dust;
this has been seen of late in my severe trials from such Serpents
and generation of Vipers.&nbsp; All the foolish, absurd
improbabilities, lies, and the most cruel and daring
misrepresentations of my natural temper and kindness to others,
good or bad; these been turned by such persons to every <a
name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>thing
infamous&mdash;while some, being high priests, on whom the
religious would have fixed their eyes instead of Jesus, or his
word, because of their name, their popularity, and property; the
last being the occasion of the rest.&nbsp; Many, to ingratiate
themselves in the favor of such, for sinister purposes, and
nothing else, have imposed upon them such things as they well
knew their hearts naturally love; then the Press has been
employed&mdash;while boys, who have been set up for teachers,
have been employed to do the Devil&rsquo;s drudgery, violate the
Sabbath, and act contrary to every law, human and divine.&nbsp;
The Press sends forth a farrago of rubbish, and in the compass of
a few pages not less than <i>eighty lies</i>, which I shall one
day expose.&nbsp; These are the sweet morsels on which thousands
of mere nominal Professors have fed, and God declares in my text
<i>they shall</i>.&mdash;Under the mask of sanctity, the garb of
holiness, and a contention for the Law, all their spleen has been
vented against me and my supposed crimes.&nbsp; But, alas, I fear
it has been rather against the great things God has done for
me.&nbsp; Witness the bitterness against my preaching, and those
who have been blessed under it.&nbsp; The lying accusation of
being an Antinomian in Principle, Preaching, and Practice, when
every person that is acquainted with the Gospel must acknowledge
that I preach <i>all the Words of this Life</i>, doctrinally,
experimentally, and practically.&nbsp; To be sure, they wonder
where I got the teaching that I have received; and <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>my
adversaries are as much puzzled about this, as those of old, who
asked, <i>How knoweth this man his letters</i>, <i>having never
learned</i>?</p>
<p>I must say here, that I feel thankful for what my enemies have
said and done against me, as I have learned much from these
things; the Spirit of God teaches by the Cross, and in the School
of Affliction much is to be derived&mdash;<i>whoso is wise will
observe these things</i>, and he shall understand the <i>loving
kindness</i> of the Lord.</p>
<p>My enemies have been perpetually representing me as an enemy
to the Law, whereas, their conduct has proved that they were
acting contrary to every Law of God and man.&nbsp; <i>Thou shalt
not go up and down</i> (not even Blackfriars Road) <i>as a
tale-bearer among thy people</i>.&mdash;<i>Levit.</i>
xix,&mdash;this was the express command of God.&mdash;<i>Thou
shalt love thy neighbour as thy self</i>, <i>whether he has
fallen among thieves or not</i>.&nbsp; <i>Speak evil of no
man</i>, says the New Testament&mdash;<i>Owe no man any thing but
love</i>.&nbsp; <i>Moreover</i>, <i>if thy brother trespass</i>,
<i>go and tell him his fault</i>, <i>between him and thee
alone</i>, (suppose it be true) <i>if he shall hear thee</i>,
<i>thou hast gained thy brother</i>&mdash;so speaks the Word of
God, which it our Rule of Walk and Conduct.&nbsp; Now, if we
consider the conduct of my holy enemies who are all zealous for
practical holiness, and see how <a name="page40"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 40</span>their demeanor corresponds with this
rule&mdash;may we not exclaim, Which is the Antinomian, me or
they?</p>
<p>How many turn sick at the success of others.&mdash;What a
wretched principle is <span
class="GutSmall">ENVY</span>&mdash;Solomon asks <i>Who can stand
before it</i>?&nbsp; But as my foes have had such a Feast on
Ashes and Dust, I only wish them a spiritual appetite, and better
food, even the Bread of eternal Life, which is meat indeed.&nbsp;
This is the joy of heaven&mdash;this is Angels food, and this is
the food on which the Believer lives.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis most
blessed to trace this Subject.&nbsp; Our Covenant God provided
it, the Holy Spirit quickens us to a spiritual hungering after
it&mdash;convinces us of the vanity of all things else
beside&mdash;brings us to love his word&mdash;to hear those
Preachers that bring forth this food; satisfies us with blessed
views of him, sweet enjoyments of his glorious Person, covenant
love, eternal mercy, his imputed righteousness, his sovereign
purposes, his atoning sacrifice, his peace-speaking blood, and
the invitations, declarations, and exceeding precious
promises.&nbsp; This is the food on which our souls live, if born
of God, and every man is known by his taste; the Serpent on those
things which are compared to dust; the Believer on that which is
called the Bread of God; hence the Promise, <i>Ye shall eat in
plenty</i>, <i>and be satisfied</i>.&nbsp; <i>Eat</i>, <i>O
friends</i>, <i>drink abundantly</i>, <i>O beloved</i>.&nbsp;
<i>The meek shall eat and be satisfied</i>.&nbsp; <i>And I will
satisfy her poor with bread</i>.&nbsp; <i>For he hath filled the
hungry </i><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span><i>with good things</i>, <i>but the rich he hath sent
empty away</i>&mdash;so all Serpents will find it.</p>
<p>The text concludes, <i>They shall not hurt nor destroy in all
my holy mountain</i>, <i>saith the Lord</i>.&mdash;This was
renewed in the New Testament, <i>Nothing shall by any means hurt
you</i>.&nbsp; And, in fact, nothing can eventually hurt the
Church; sin cannot, as it is atoned for&mdash;the guilt of it is
gone&mdash;the love of it is removed as the love of Jesus comes
into the mind; and the power and dominion of it is removed by
almighty Grace, <i>the stronger than the strong man
armed</i>&mdash;the Law cannot, because it is well satisfied with
the Obedience of the adorable Surety&mdash;Satan cannot; frighten
he may, but cannot touch them to their injury, for his very
temptations make us hate him the more&mdash;Our own inbred
corruptions cannot hurt us; they are more trying to us, the more
we loath them and abhor ourselves, as vile in God&rsquo;s
sight&mdash;the World cannot, as it is overcome for us, and the
Faith God has given will overcome it in us.&nbsp; Pharisees,
Hypocrites, and Impostors, with their damnable errors cannot,
though they may cause us much trouble.&nbsp; Yet this will
furnish us with much matter for Prayer and fear: these things
will drive us nearer to God&mdash;nor can poverty, pain,
reproach, or sorrow do it, for these shew us this is not our
rest, it is polluted; and all these work together for good, as
sure as we are the called, according to his Plan.&nbsp; These can
neither hurt nor destroy one bud of hope, <a
name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>or faith, or
desire, or affection, either to God or his truth.&nbsp; Nor can
they destroy the soul, God loves it too well, and Jesus has paid
too great a price to permit it to be lost.&nbsp; Besides, it is
the temple of the holy and eternal Spirit; who then can destroy
it?</p>
<p>The Church is called <i>God&rsquo;s holy
Mountain</i>&mdash;typified by <i>Mount Sion</i>, firmly settled
in the eternal love, and everlasting purposes of Grace.&nbsp;
Conspicuous and useful in the world, and which, as a great
Mountain, shall fill the whole earth in the latter day.&nbsp;
They are called a holy people; the Lord Jesus Christ is their
holiness before God, <i>Ye are compleat in him</i>, <i>who of God
is made unto us Sanctification</i>.&nbsp; Secondly, All their
holiness is received from him, as the High Priest of their
profession; anointed, and taught by him, as a Prophet; they obey
his commands, as a King; this constitutes them holy, as their
faith embraced the atonement and righteousness of Christ; the
holy Spirit&rsquo;s gracious inhabitation leads them to love and
delight in God, his ways, his truth, his people, and his
ordinances; having grace given to walk in wisdom to them that are
without: this is real holiness, nothing short of this is
scriptural holiness, and this is the Work of God; this proves our
union to the Saviour, and this is our meetness for glory, and
<i>such honor have all the Saints</i>.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
